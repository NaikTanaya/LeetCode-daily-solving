// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [5,5,5]
// Output: 15
// Explanation: The only possible polygon that can be made from nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.

// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]
// Output: 12
// Explanation: The polygon with the largest perimeter which can be made from nums has 5 sides: 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.
// We cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as the longest side because it is not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them.
// It can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.

// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [5,5,50]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: There is no possible way to form a polygon from nums, as a polygon has at least 3 sides and 50 > 5 + 5.
