// Example 1:

// Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
// - Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
// - Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
// - Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
// - Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
// It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.

// Example 2:

// Input: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2
// Output: 7

// Example 3:

// Input: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0
// Output: 3
